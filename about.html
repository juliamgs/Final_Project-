                <p>
                    Beyond design and development, I'm passionate about accessibility advocacy and inclusive design practices. 
                    I believe technology should empower all users, regardless of their abilities or backgrounds.

                <p>
                    I'm constantly learning about emerging technologies and design trends, always seeking ways to improve 
                    my craft and create more impactful user experiences. When I'm not designing, you'll find me exploring 
                    new tools, reading about UX research methodologies, or contributing to design communities.
